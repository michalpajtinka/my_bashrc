# my_bashrc
My version of .bashrc file. On Mac system, you may have to put line "source ./.bashrc" in you .bash_profile file to make it work. There are some useful git aliases based on https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh

# TODO
- extract aliases (at least git aliases) to separate script (to be called from here) to keep it simple and well structured
- think about some more TODOs
